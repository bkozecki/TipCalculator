## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I have learnd about the input event listener and how to include it into functions.

### Continued development

I am very happy about being able to finish this challange on my own, even though the code isn't spectacularly elegant I was able to get the funcionality working. Will update the code as my skill and uderstanding grows.
